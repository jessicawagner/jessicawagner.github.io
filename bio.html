        Jessica Ann Wagner was born in Chicago, Illinois and currently lives and works in

Austin, Texas. She is a practicing witch and much of her work evolves from her

relationship to the craft and collaboration with the universe. This idea is transposed

with witchcraftâ€™s relationship to feminism and the empowerment of women through

a connection to the cosmos. She is influenced by artists such as Ana Mendieta,

Marina Abramovic, and Kiki Smith. Jessica uses natural materials in her work such

as dirt, flowers, animal fossils, and leaves. The pigments and remains from these

materials take on a new life of representation. Often the work is set on fire in

specific ceremonies and the ashes are used to make new work. Her work is an ever-

evolving process of life, death, rebirth, and ceremony. The underlying being that her

entire life is her art practice.

      <p class="biotxt">
        Jessica received her BFA in Painting from the University of Illinois at Chicago in

2007 and her MFA in Visual Arts from the Vermont College of Fine Arts in 2016. She

hopes to achieve an even closer relationship between her spiritual practice and her

work by turning the process into performances in which the audience will take part.
